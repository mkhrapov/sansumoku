## For developers

What would you find interesting in this repo as a developer?

- Custom board is implemented using drawing in Core Graphics
- A number of AI Engines implemented in C and C++, so you can learn how to integrate reasonably complex C and C++ code with Swift.
- [Monte Carlo Tree Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search) algorithm. I gave a talk about Monte Carlo Tree
  Search at the Austin Algorithms Meetup. [PDF Slides](extra/MonteCarloTreeSearch.pdf).
- AI Engine implemented using Apple's [GameplayKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit),
  so you can learn how to use [GKMonteCarloStrategist](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gkmontecarlostrategist).
